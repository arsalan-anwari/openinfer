OpenInfer Documentation
=======================

OpenInfer is an edge-focused ML transpilation framework. It lets you express
inference pipelines in a Rust-embedded DSL, validate them in a host-side
simulator, and then synthesize fully static, device-specific source code for
deployment on constrained hardware.
