# DSL Philosophy

The DSL is intentionally:

* Explicit
* Verbose
* Structured

This ensures:

* Control flow is visible
* Side effects are explicit
* Optimizations are safe
* Generated code is predictable

The DSL describes **intent**, not implementation.

## Non-Goals

* Training
* Automatic model conversion
* Implicit execution
* Python-first APIs
