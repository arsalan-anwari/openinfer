## Summary

Brief description of the feature or capability being requested.

---

## Problem Statement

What limitation or missing capability does this address?
What are you trying to accomplish that is currently difficult or impossible?

---

## Proposed Solution

Describe the feature in as much technical detail as possible:

* new HAL capability?
* new backend or driver?
* API changes?
* runtime integration?
* testing or tooling additions?

---

## Target Devices / Platforms

Which hardware or environments would this affect?

* CPU architecture:
* GPU / accelerator:
* OS:
* drivers / runtimes:

---

## Alternatives Considered

Have you tried other approaches, tools, or libraries?
Why are they insufficient?

---

## Scope & Complexity (if known)

If you have thoughts on:

* expected implementation size
* major design challenges
* breaking changes
* performance implications

list them here.

---

## Testing Strategy

How should this be validated?

* unit tests
* cross-device correctness tests
* performance benchmarks
* CI coverage
* fuzzing / stress tests

---

## Backward Compatibility

Would this change existing APIs or behavior?
If yes, explain how.

---

## Additional Context

Links, papers, prior art, code examples, mock APIs, or similar projects.

---

## Checklist
